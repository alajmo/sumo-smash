# Sumo Smash

A party game for everyone.

## Get Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Download Unity version 2019.1.12f1 (we attempt to always stay up to date with the latest stable version).

## Unity Workflow

- We use separate scenes for debugging different features. For instance, debugging the food spawn can be done in the [food scene](Assets/Scenes/DebugScenes/FoodScene.unity).
- To work on a feature or scene, you need to lock that scene so other people don't modify it since there are issues with people working on the same scene.

## Kanban Workflow

We use 5 columns (Backlog, Iteration, Doing, Blocked and Done).

- Backlog: Put all possible ideas here.
- Iteration: The current iteration.
- Doing: What we're currently doing, ideally keep 1 thing per person in this column
- Blocked: Cards which are blocked for some reason
- Done: Cards that are finished (or if we decide to not implement card content, they are moved here as well)

## IDE

We use Visual Studio Code with the following plugins:

- C#
- Debugger for Unity
- Unity Code Snippets
- Unity Tools

## Design

We use [Blender](https://www.blender.org) to design 3D assets.
